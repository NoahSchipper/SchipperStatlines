An interactive baseball statistics project modeled after stathead's versus finder. This project provides comprehensive baseball analytics and comparison capabilities using historical and modern baseball data.

## Features

1. Player Comparisons: Side-by-side statistical comparisons between both baseball players and teams

2. Team Analysis: Comprehensive team performance metrics and historical data

3. Historical Data: Access to extensive historical baseball records

4. Advanced Metrics: Modern sabermetric statistics and analytics

## Data Sources

1. Lahman Database: Historical baseball statistics dating back to 1871

2. pybaseball: Modern baseball data and advanced statistics

3. Jeff Bagwell Data: Specialized baseball analytics datasets

4. Retrosheet: Play-by-play baseball data for detailed analysis

## Notes

This project is inspired by and modeled after stathead baseball's versus finder. Schipper Statlines is created for educational purposes

The code in app.py isn't the cleanest due to a time crunch before the fall semester starts. I will organize it if/when I find the time.

The code for the player version of Schipper Statlines is still present in app.py despite it not being interactable so that viewers here can still look at that code.
